# 🐾 Focus Companion | Cozy Study Buddy

Focus Companion is a minimalist, aesthetic Pomodoro timer designed to make productivity feel more like a journey with a digital pet. It combines a clean user interface with a persistent To-Do list to help users manage their time and tasks effectively.

## ✨ Features

### ⏲️ Smart Pomodoro Timer
* **Time Management**: Default 25-minute focus sessions to maximize productivity.
* **State Awareness**: The app tracks three distinct states: **Sleeping** (Idle), **Focused** (Running), and **Finished** (Complete).
* **Audio Alerts**: Includes a built-in alarm sound to notify you when your session is over.

### 🐱 Interactive Pet Feedback
* **Visual Cues**: An animated emoji pet reacts to your productivity. It sleeps when you're idle, focuses with you when the timer starts, and celebrates your success when you finish.
* **Smooth Animations**: Features a gentle "idle" bounce to keep your workspace feeling alive.

### 📝 Integrated To-Do List
* **Task Management**: Quickly add tasks to your queue.
* **Strike-through Completion**: Simply click a task to mark it as finished.
* **Persistent Storage**: Powered by `localStorage`, meaning your tasks stay saved even if you refresh the page or close your browser.
* **Bulk Actions**: A "Clear All" option to reset your list for a fresh start.
